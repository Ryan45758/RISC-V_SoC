WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_dbgmon/u_sram_0/memory_reg has an input control pin soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_dbgmon/u_sram_0/memory_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_dbgmon/u_sram_0/ADDRBWRADDR[5]) which is driven by a register (soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_dbgmon/stop_trace_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
WARNING: [Place 30-568] A LUT 'soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_cpu_top/u_clkmnt/u_cg/medeleg_imisalign_i_3' is driving clock pin of 7841 registers. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved registers are:
	soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_cpu_top/u_dpu/addr_latch_reg[0] {FDCE}

INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	riscv_jtag_tck_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y84
	riscv_jtag_tck_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

WARNING: [DRC PLCK-12] Clock Placer Checks: Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	riscv_jtag_tck_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y84
	riscv_jtag_tck_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0
