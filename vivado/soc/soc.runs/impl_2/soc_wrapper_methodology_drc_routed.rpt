TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT soc_i/cpu_wrap_0/inst/u_cpu_top/u_clkmnt/u_cg/satp_ppn[43]_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
